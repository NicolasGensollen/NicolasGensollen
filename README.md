Hi there! :wave:

Before joining INRIA, I was a postdoctoral reasearcher in the [Complex Networks team](https://www.complexnetworks.fr/), at the [computer science laboratory of Paris 6](https://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en) (LIP6) from December 2018 to October 2020, and a postdoctoral researcher in the [Power Systems Design and Studies](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/power-systems-design-studies.html) group at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/) (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, USA :us: from March 2017 to November 2018. .

I obtained my PhD in October 2016, at [Telecom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en/), Saclay, France. My PhD work was focused on *modeling and optimizing smart power grid systems*. You can find more details in my [CV](https://nicolasgensollen.github.io/cv/).

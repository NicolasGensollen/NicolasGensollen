Hi there! :wave:

I am currently a [SED](https://sed.paris.inria.fr/service/) research engineer at the [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en) [Paris center](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-de-paris), in France :fr:, working mostly in the [ARAMIS team](https://www.aramislab.fr) located at the [Paris Brain Institute](https://icm-institute.org/en/mission-en/) (ICM). Part of my work is dedicated to neuro-science tools like [Clinica](https://www.clinica.run) or [Leaspy](https://leaspy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), developed by the ARAMIS team.

Before joining the Paris center, I was a research engineer in the [PARIETAL team](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/research/) at [Saclay center](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-saclay-centre) of INRIA. I was mainly working on developping and maintaining neuro-science :brain: and machine learning softwares like [Nilearn](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn) in which I am still involved as a core developer.

Before joining INRIA, I was a postdoctoral reasearcher in the [Complex Networks team](https://www.complexnetworks.fr/), at the [computer science laboratory of Paris 6](https://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en) (LIP6) from December 2018 to October 2020, and a postdoctoral researcher in the [Power Systems Design and Studies](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/power-systems-design-studies.html) group at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/) (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, USA :us: from March 2017 to November 2018. .

I obtained my PhD in October 2016, at [Telecom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en/), Saclay, France. My PhD work was focused on *modeling and optimizing smart power grid systems*. You can find more details in my [CV](https://nicolasgensollen.github.io/cv/).
